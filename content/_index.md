I'm not great at writing, but want to write about programming.

Haven't been very consistent so far, but I'd like to think this will improve. You might see posts about one of those topics here:

- Nix
- Rust
- Haskell
- Python
- JS

I read my emails, so you can contact me via the provided email address. Otherwise you can open issues in any of the featured projects.
